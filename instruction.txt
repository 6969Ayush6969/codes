For first,run copy and paste in terminal 
' pip install -r .\requirements.txt '
in case error occured that  'cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.'
To fix follow the steps:-

1.Run Microsoft Powershell as 'Run as administrator'
2.paste:  Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned       
(used remote signed  because its a bit more safe than unrestricted. It allows mostly local files to run)
3.run and type 'Y' 
now try activating the virtual environment, It will most probably run


To initialize,Run 'main.py' 
Just say 'jarvis'(Its not very accurate, It may take few attempts for it to reply), It will reply with a 'yes'.
You may ask him to:
1.open youtube
2.open instagram
3.you can add custom playlist at 'songplaylist.py'(Instruction given there)
4.search any youtube channel(just say the channel name at last)
